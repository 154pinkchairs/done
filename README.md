# Done

A [fish](https://fishshell.com/) plug-in to automatically get notified when long processes are finished.

## Install


### With [Fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/)
```
fisher done
```

### Manually

```
curl -Lo ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_right_prompt.fish --create-dirs raw.githubusercontent.com/fisherman/done/master/fish_right_prompt.fish
```

## Usage

Just go on with your normal life. You will get a notification when processes which take longer than 10 seconds finish, if the terminal window is in the background.
Customizing these settings may be supported in the future.

## Compatibility

Implemented using fish_right_prompt, so it can be used together with other fish_prompt packages. Except if they also implement a fish_right_prompt.

## Support
- OS X 10.8+: Notification Center
- Linux: Planned
- Windows: Planned
