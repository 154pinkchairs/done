Just go on with your normal life. You will get a notification when a process takes more than 10 seconds finish, and the terminal window not in the foreground.
Customizing these settings may be supported in the future.

To test you could type, for instance `sleep 15`, and start using other app. After 15 seconds you should get a notification.



## Install


#### Using [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/)
```bash
fisher install done
```

#### Manually
```bash
curl -Lo ~/.config/fish/functions/humanize_duration.fish --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fisherman/humanize_duration/master/humanize_duration.fish
curl -Lo ~/.config/fish/conf.d/done.fish --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fisherman/done/master/conf.d/done.fish
```

## Dependencies
If you want notifications with icons on macOS, please install `terminal-notifier`

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

## Update

```bash
fisher update
```

[Subscribe](http://eepurl.com/cAcU3P) to be notified on updates.

## Configure


```bash
# Notify only if command takes more than 5000 ms
set -U __done_min_cmd_duration 5000  # default

# Don't notify on git commands, except `git push` and `git pull`.
# This is useful for commands like `git commit` which often trigger and wait for an editor outside the terminal.
# Since the focus is on the editor and not the terminal, without this you would get notified on every commit.
set -U __done_exclude 'git (?!push|pull)'  # default, accepts a regular expression
```

## Support
- fish 2.3.0+
- macOS 10.8+ via Notification Center.
- Linux via `notify-send`. Otherwise bell sound is played.
- Windows: Upvote https://github.com/fisherman/done/issues/5 if interested.
